<p><em>Josaphat Valdivia</em> is Embedded Software Engineer and Co-Founder at <strong>Case Wallet Inc</strong>.  He generally spends his time writing code of all varieties for all kinds of pet projects.</p>

<p>Josaphat graduated from <strong>RIT</strong> with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering (Software Engineering option) in May 2015.  He is not currently in search of employment.</p>

<p>Josaphat is a proficient software developer, leveraging good Software Engineering practice in all of his projects.  His is proficient in C, C++, and Java, and knows enough Python and C# to break builds.  He can grok shell scripts, has experience programming for the web using tecnologies such as PHP, ASP.NET, and Javascript (both with and without JQuery).  He occasionally likes to mention that &ldquo;Spanish is like a first language&rdquo; to him because he is bilingual.  Though his proficiency in English surpassed his Spanish after years of English-only schooling.</p>

<p>Josaphat is skilled at wielding the English language, both written and spoken.  He is a confident public speaker and even won first place in the 2012 RIT Institute Speaking Contest with his speech about the number of people who don&rsquo;t vote.</p>

<p>Over the last six years of coursework and on-the-job experience, Josaphat has accumulated working knowledge of many development tools and technologies, including HCS12 assembly, Matlab, Octave, robotics, CSS, and GNU Assembler for Cortex-M ARM architectures.  During the past year or so he&rsquo;s transitioned to using GNU/Linux as his primary computing environment and is now a mostly-former user of Microsoft Windows.  He uses git as his VCS of choice and knows how to leverage GNU/Linux as an integrated development environment.  His editor of choice is vim (with <a href="https://github.com/Josaphat/dotfiles">a few additions</a>) though he is currently working on using emacs whenver time is not a constraint so that he can better unerstand how the other half lives.</p>

<p>Josaphat took a course on computer graphics while at RIT and learned about the fundamentals of the subject using SDL as well as OpenGL.  He will with some regularity explore game design and development using SDL, OpenGL, and frameworks like XNA and Monogame, but his experiments rarely go further than creating small applications where users can move sprites on a screen with some rudimentary collision detection.  He is stubbornly satisfied with having learned a bit more about game design and game development with each foray.</p>

<p>For the last couple of years he&rsquo;s been an enthusiastic and increasingly proficient user of LaTeX, using it for lab reports, essays, proposals, etc.  He does know how to use more conventional office application suites, primarly LibreOffice, for when haste is required above formality.  In addition to the word processors of both LibreOffice and Microsoft Office, he knows how to use their respective spreadsheet applications.</p>

<p>Currently, Josaphat has little free time, but when the opportunity arises he picks up his guitar and plays a few tunes, or plays video games, and explores some computing technology.  He intends for the blog on this site to showcase some of these hobby projects.</p>

<p>He and a group of friends from RIT are slowly making progress on a game called &ldquo;Vale&rdquo;, the concept for which his friends originally created as part of a course on developing games using DirectX.  The new version of Vale is being written using Monogame.  You can track its progress on <a href="https://github.com/Hashrap/Vale--MonoGame-">the GitHub repository</a>.</p>
