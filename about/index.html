	<p><em>Josaphat Valdivia</em> is Senior Software Engineer at <strong>Datto</strong>.  People
tend call him &ldquo;Jos&rdquo; (pronounced
<a href="https://itinerarium.github.io/phoneme-synthesis/?w=/'d%CA%92os/">/&lsquo;dʒos/</a>),
for short.</p>
<p>Josaphat is a proficient software developer, leveraging good Software
Engineering practice in all of his projects.  He is most proficient in
C++ and C, has a working knowledge of Python, and knows enough C#,
Java, Rust, and go to break builds.  He can grok shell scripts, has
experience programming for the web using technologies such as PHP,
ASP.NET, and Javascript.  He occasionally likes to mention that
&ldquo;Spanish is like a first language&rdquo; to him because he is bilingual.
Though his proficiency in English surpassed his Spanish after years of
English-only schooling.</p>
<p>Josaphat is skilled at wielding the English language, both written and
spoken.  He is a confident public speaker and is adept at giving
engaging presentations on technical topics.</p>
<p>Over the last 13 years of college-level coursework and on-the-job
experience, Josaphat has been exposed to a wide range of development
tools and technologies, including Matlab and Octave, robotics, CSS,
and GNU Assembler for Cortex-M ARM architectures.  He uses GNU/Linux
as his primary development environment and is a mostly-former MS
Windows user. He is proficient with git as a VCS and knows how to
leverage GNU/Linux as an integrated development environment.  He
mostly uses emacs for development. His primary editor used to be vim
(with <a href="https://github.com/Josaphat/dotfiles">a few additions</a>). He
still occasionally uses vim, usually for quick editing of things like
config files.</p>
<p>Josaphat had some exposure to computer graphics while at RIT where he
learned about the fundamentals of the subject using SDL and OpenGL.
He will with some regularity fail at game design and development using
SDL, OpenGL, and frameworks like XNA and Monogame; the efforts usually
peter out due to the sheer effort required to really build anything
fun.  He is stubbornly satisfied with having learned a bit more about
game design and development with each foray.</p>
<p>Josaphat likes to use org-mode in emacs for digital notes. For writing
formal documents or anything that might actually make its way onto
paper, he likes to use LaTeX. He&rsquo;s also familiar with conventional
productivity suites including Microsoft Office, LibreOffice, and
Google&rsquo;s suite.</p>
<p>Josaphat likes to play guitar in his free time. With some regularity,
he creates some experimental software. Much of it finds its way onto
his <a href="https://github.com/Josaphat">GitHub Page</a>, though recently he&rsquo;s
been trying to use sourcehut (<a href="https://sr.ht/~jos/">sr.ht/~jos</a>) more.
Almost none of it is of practical use.</p>
<h3 id="professional-history">Professional History</h3>
<p>Josaphat graduated from <strong>RIT</strong> Bachelors of Science in Computer
Engineering (Software Engineering option) in May 2015.</p>
<p>As part of his degree, he did a co-op with Brand Networks over the
winter of 2012 into spring of 2013. There he worked as a full-stack
developer on the now-defunct American Express website, OpenForum.com
(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522074617/https://www.openforum.com/">archived May
2013</a>),
built on PHP and Wordpress.</p>
<p>In June of 2014, Josaphat joined the effort to start a company
initially called Cryptolabs. Before long, the company was re-named to
<strong>Case Wallet</strong> and released a product called <em>Case</em>, a
biometrically-secured bitcoin wallet implemented in dedicated hardware
(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150711085017/https://choosecase.com/">product page archived July
2015</a>)
.  After production of the wallet, focus shifted to development a
biometrically-secured, continuously-authenticated wearable smart-ring
which eventually came to be called <a href="https://www.tokenring.com/"><em>Token
Ring</em></a>. The company was renamed <strong>Token</strong>
to match the new direction.</p>
<p>As part of a small team of engineers, Josaphat helped to develop the
embedded software running on the Case Wallet. This included doing
board bring-up, designing and developing C code targeting bare-metal
ARM. Among other things, Josaphat helped developed code to integrate
peripherals over serial interfaces (UART, SPI, I2C), including a
fingerprint scanner, an e-ink display, and a 2G modem.</p>
<p>This was the best way to begin a career as a software developer. By
working on bare-metal code, Josaphat had to learn how to write
production quality software in an environment not dissimilar from the
dawn of modern computing.</p>
<p>When focus shifted to the Token ring, Josaphat took on the role of a
Software Architect and developed the architecture underpinning the
software for the wearable. He advocated for use of modern C++ over C
for embedded software, developed automated testing infrastructure
which included Jenkins pipelines, developed and coached the team on
techniques for unit testing code on embedded systems, and more, all in
addition to being a core contributor to the embedded software itself.</p>
<p>In 2019, Josaphat decided to leave Token and joined REDCOM as a
Software Engineer developing Sigma, a unified telecommunications
platform integrating open technologies such as SIP and XMPP. His
largest contributions there were developing a subsystem to bridge
communications between push-to-talk radios and SIP-based phone
infrastructure, as well as the backend of a new switchboard-like
feature which allows an operator to patch together different lines in
the system into ad-hoc groups.</p>
<p>In May 2022, Josaphat joined Datto as a Senior Software Engineer
working on BCDR Agents. As of this writing in early July, Josaphat has
only been with Datto for a little over a month, so he is still
learning the ropes. However, he has already made a few small but
significant contributions improving the design and security of the
agents software.</p>
<p>Josaphat occasionally performs light contract work on the development
of ARM-based NFC payment systems. You can inquire about these services
via email, but he&rsquo;s generally not receptive unless you&rsquo;re part of his
professional network.</p>
