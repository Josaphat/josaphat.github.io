        <h1>About Josaphat</h1>
        <p><em>Josaphat Valdivia</em> is the name of the Computer Engineering Undergraduate student who is Embedded Software Engineer and Co-Founder at <strong>Case Wallet Inc</strong>.
        He generally spends his time writing code of all varieties for all kinds of pet projects.</p>
        <p>Aside from his day-job writing the firmware which powers <a href="http://choosecase.com">Case Wallet</a>, he is currently working on a <a href="http://kgcoe-git.rit.edu/jxv1308/fitnesstrainer">Fitness Trainer</a> project for his senior design course, also with the primary focus of writing embedded software. In addition, he's taking a course on Digital I.C. Design, where he is learning how to design CMOS circuits using CAD tools and VHDL.</p>
        <p>He expects to obtain his <strong>Bachelors of Science in
            Computer Engineering with Software Engineering Option</strong> this <strong>May 2015</strong>.
        He is not currently in search of employment.</p>

        <p>Josaphat is a proficient software developer, leveraging good software engineering practice in all of his projects.
        He is proficient in <strong>C</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, and <strong>Java</strong>, and knows <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>C#</strong> well enough to break builds.
        He can grok shell scripts, has experience programming for the web using technologies like <strong>ASP.NET</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong>, and <strong>Javascript</strong> (with and without <strong>JQuery</strong>).
        He occasionally likes to mention that "Spanish is like a first language to me" because it is, though his proficiency in English surpasses his Spanish.
        </p>

        <p>Josaphat is skilled at wielding the English language in both writing and speech.
        He is a confident public speaker and even won first place in the <em>2012 RIT Institute Speaking Contest</em> with his speech about the number of people who don't vote.</p>

        <p>Over the last six years of coursework and on-the-job co-op experience, Josaphat has accumulated working knowledge of HCS12 assembly, Matlab and Octave, robotics, CSS, and GNU Assembler for Cortex-M ARM architectures.
        During the past year or so he's transitioned to using GNU/Linux as his primary computing environment and is now a nearly-former- but still proficient user of Microsoft Windows.
        He uses <strong>git</strong> as his VCS of choice and knows how to leverage GNU/Linux as an integrated development environment.
        His editor of choice is vim (with quite a few customizations) though he is currently working on using emacs whenever time is not a constraint so that he can better learn how the other half lives.
        </p>

        <p>Josaphat took a course on computer graphics once and learned about the fundamentals using SDL as well as OpenGL. He will with some regularity explore creating "games" using SDL, OpenGL, and frameworks like XNA and Monogame, but he ends up just creating software applications where users can move sprites around on a screen with some rudimentary collision detection. He is stubbornly satisfied with having learned a little more about game design and programming with each foray.</p>

        <p>For the last couple of years he's been an enthusiastic and proficient user of <strong>LaTeX</strong>, using it for lab reports, essays, proposals, etc.
        He does, however, know how to use the more traditional LibreOffice Writer for word processing documents which require haste above formality, and he excels [ <code>:^)</code> ] at using LibreOffice Calc for spreadsheets.
        He is also familiar with the Microsoft Office counterparts of the aforementioned LibreOffice applications.</p>

        <h3>Note from the subject</h3>
        <p>
        The author neglected to mention the things that I do in my free time.
        Currently, I have very little free time, but when the opportunity arises I pick up my guitar and play a few songs, or I play video games, and sometimes I explore something computer-related (like creating a personal website or writing a "game").</p>

        <strong>Warning:</strong> The resume is not nearly as enjoyable to read and, due to its brevity, it fails to touch upon all of the skills the author has mentioned above.
