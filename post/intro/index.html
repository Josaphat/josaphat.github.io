	<p>This is my first(ish) blog post.  I&rsquo;ve had other blogs in the past (hosted on blogger), but they&rsquo;ve never stuck because their focus has always been wrong.  At one point I did a blog that was a catalog of things I thought were interesting in my life.  I did one with a political focus; that lasted for a couple of months.  One was about song writing.  As I write this, I still have a first blog post about how I was going to share my journey through designing a game and it has over 200 views (sorry to whoever saw that, became excited, and never got a second post).  The blog never went further than the first post and the game itself was abandoned soon after, as school and life demanded all of my attention&mdash;or perhaps &ldquo;sapped all of my motivation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now I realize that I love to share things that I love.  It seems obvious.  Certainly, it&rsquo;s much easier to stay motivated on a project when you&rsquo;re doing something you love.  Having an audience for your work is a very intersting way to get motivation.  It forces a kind of responsibility to continue making progress and to continue sharing that progress.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got a few projects rattling around in my head.  I&rsquo;ll publish those in case you, my dear reader, decide that my proposals are great ideas you should spend your time on.  Until I get the ball rolling on one of those projects I&rsquo;m going to dedicate this space to writing little blurbs about programming, my experiences, etc.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t said what this blog is going to be about.  It&rsquo;s going to be about everything, with the common thread being that it&rsquo;s relevant to me somehow.  If that sounds egotistical, it is; but writing a blog is quite egotistical to begin with.  I dare to believe that the things I have to say are worth sharing with the world.</p>

<p>Might as well.</p>

<p>My hope is that you&rsquo;ll find what I have to say useful.  If not, then I&rsquo;ll settle for <em>interesting</em> or <em>entertaining</em>.</p>
