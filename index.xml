      <title>Ditching GitHub</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the acquisition of GitHub by Microsoft in 2018, I&amp;rsquo;ve looked at
the service a bit askance. But even though I&amp;rsquo;m quasi against it,
GitHub&amp;rsquo;s ethics have never really affected me or forced me to reckon
with them since I&amp;rsquo;m not particularly active in any open source
projects and nobody cares about mine. Recently, though, I&amp;rsquo;ve resolved
to live my values a bit better and am now working on ditching GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quite a few years ago now, during the downtime on a work trip, one of
my colleagues jokingly obtained the domain and howoldis.space and we
generated a website to answer that very question: Just how old is
space, exactly?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first and most logical thing I have to talk about is this website.  Bear with it if some things aren&amp;rsquo;t perfect; it&amp;rsquo;s still a work-in-progress, but I&amp;rsquo;ve waited until it at least got to a presentable point before publishing it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
