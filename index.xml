      <description>The first and most logical thing I have to talk about is this website. Bear with it if some things aren&amp;rsquo;t perfect; it&amp;rsquo;s still a work-in-progress, but I&amp;rsquo;ve waited until it at least got to a presentable point before publishing it.
If you&amp;rsquo;re on the latest Chrome or Firefox, these pages should already look mostly complete (the footer being the only thing in need of some polish). If you&amp;rsquo;re viewing the site on elinks, w3m, and probably other text-only web browsers, then the state of the site ought to be indistinguishable from complete.</description>

      <description>This is my first(ish) blog post. I&amp;rsquo;ve had other blogs in the past (hosted on blogger), but they&amp;rsquo;ve never stuck because their focus has always been wrong. At one point I did a blog that was a catalog of things I thought were interesting in my life. I did one with a political focus; that lasted for a couple of months. One was about song writing. As I write this, I still have a first blog post about how I was going to share my journey through designing a game and it has over 200 views (sorry to whoever saw that, became excited, and never got a second post).</description>
