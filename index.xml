      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The first and most logical thing I have to talk about is this website.  Bear with it if some things aren&amp;rsquo;t perfect; it&amp;rsquo;s still a work-in-progress, but I&amp;rsquo;ve waited until it at least got to a presentable point before publishing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re on the latest Chrome or Firefox, these pages should already look mostly complete (the footer being the only thing in need of some polish).  If you&amp;rsquo;re viewing the site on elinks, w3m, and probably other text-only web browsers, then the state of the site ought to be indistinguishable from complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find any problems with the site or have any questions about it, feel free to contact me ( &lt;code&gt;jos at josaphat.co&lt;/code&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This website is powered by &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;hugo&lt;/a&gt;, the static website engine.  Although the community around hugo has provided a wide collection of ready-made themes, I found every single one of them bloated with &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; web design.  Even the theme claiming that it leaves out everything &amp;ldquo;fancy&amp;rdquo; used poor markup and relied extensively on fetching a large style-sheet from some external website.  The look and feel was minimalist, but seeing the code made it feel bloated.  All of the other designs were too &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo;, with front-pages that include an enormous hero image and which &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; users to scroll for the tiniest bit of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hugo&lt;/strong&gt; is great, but these themes&amp;hellip;?  Not so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead of going with any of those themes, I took the most minimalist theme I could find as inspiration (in this case &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gizak/nofancy/&#34;&gt;nofancy&lt;/a&gt;) and actually removed all of the fancy.  Thus far, I&amp;rsquo;m pleased with the results.  The HTML/CSS I&amp;rsquo;ve written displays static text with a little bit of makeup.  Without leaving the CSS out entirely, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t get more minimalist than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The generated source code is available, of course, using your browser.  Once I&amp;rsquo;m satisfied that the look and feel of the site is complete, I will open a pull request to have it included in the hugo repository&amp;rsquo;s list of themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;go-s-template-library:c4936d20617dd9e4507ca2b80203dc13&#34;&gt;Go&amp;rsquo;s Template Library&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugo leverages Go&amp;rsquo;s html template library to generate webpages.  You can embed some logic in HTML code so that the engine can output variables into web pages for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a template is very simple.  Template logic goes inside double curly braces &lt;code&gt;{{  }}&lt;/code&gt; and you can do things like include &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; statements, and use pseudo-for-loops using go&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;range&lt;/code&gt; keyword to generate lists of things like post tags.  Interestingly, you can create and use &amp;ldquo;local&amp;rdquo; variables which are declared using &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code snippet at the bottom of the page includes examples of the template system in action.  The variables are for the most part provided by hugo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;favicons:c4936d20617dd9e4507ca2b80203dc13&#34;&gt;Favicons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not familiar with the format that favicons are supposed to be, and apparently there are a whole host of file formats that you need to create in order to accommodate as many platforms as possible.  Interesting though it would have been to try and create the favicon myself, I decided to just defer to &lt;a href=&#34;http://realfavicongenerator.net/&#34;&gt;realfavicongenerator&lt;/a&gt;.  The source image should be 260x260.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have any images that come to mind when I think of myself, so I just made my little icon &lt;code&gt;J.&lt;/code&gt; in my favorite font, Source Code Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;code-of-note:c4936d20617dd9e4507ca2b80203dc13&#34;&gt;Code of Note&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most difficult part about this was creating the header bar such that the name of the website was on the left, but a list of top-level pages displayed on the right.  The most straightforward, float-free way that I found to accomplish this was on &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/a/10277235/1823076&#34;&gt;stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt;.  It uses &lt;code&gt;text-align: justify;&lt;/code&gt; to turn the navigation bar into a paragraph where the left-most and right-most blocks on a line are spread apart with whitespace so that the line is flush with both margins.  This is the same effect you see in newsprint, which I have tried to recreate below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;You  may  notice  in  newsprint
that  spaces  are  inserted  in
the middle of lines to  get the
lines to be flush with both the
left   and   right  marg i n s.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick works by using blocks instead of words on a line (the line being the header bar).  It then asks the renderer to justify the line, forcing the left block&amp;rsquo;s left edge to line up with the left margin and the right block&amp;rsquo;s right edge to line up with the right margin.  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that the results would be aesthetically appealing if three or more blocks of differing lengths were used instead.  If it works with blocks the same as with text, then extra space won&amp;rsquo;t necessarily be distributed evenly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, the two blocks are the website title (contained in an anchor tag), and a list of links (the list of size one, but it&amp;rsquo;s still enclosed in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags).  I won&amp;rsquo;t pretend to understand the intricacies of the CSS for this technique (I still have no idea why the &lt;code&gt;::after&lt;/code&gt; bit is necessary to make it work) so I&amp;rsquo;ll just present the snippet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the HTML partial for the header bar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;navbar&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    {{ $baseurl := .Site.BaseURL }}
    &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;site-title&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{ .Site.Title }}&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;ul class=&amp;quot;menu-list&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
        {{ range $name, $page := .Site.Taxonomies.categories }}
        &amp;lt;li class=&amp;quot;menu-item&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;{{ $baseurl }}categories/{{ $name | urlize }}&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;menu-link&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
                {{ $name | title }}
            &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
        {{ end }}
        &amp;lt;li class=&amp;quot;menu-item&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;{{ $baseurl }}about/&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;menu-link&amp;quot;&amp;gt;About&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the CSS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.navbar {
    text-align: justify;
    font-size: 22px;
    border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;

    /* IE special */
    -ms-text-justify: distribute-all-lines;
    text-justify: distribute-all-lines;
}
.navbar:after {
    content: &#39;&#39;;
    display: inline-block;
    width: 100%;
    height: 0;
    font-size: 0;
    line-height: 0;
}
.site-title {
    display: inline-block;
    font-size: 26px;
    font-color: #ddd;
    text-decoration: none;

    /* ie 7 */
    *display: inline;
    *zoom: 1;
    *text-align: left;
}
.menu-list {
    display: inline-block;
    list-style: none;
    vertical-align: baseline;
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    /* ie 7 */
    *display: inline;
    *zoom: 1;
    *text-align: right;
}
.menu-item {
    display: inline;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>First Post</title>
      <link>http://josaphat.co/post/intro/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2015 16:31:03 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://josaphat.co/post/intro/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my first(ish) blog post.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had other blogs in the past (hosted on blogger), but they&amp;rsquo;ve never stuck because their focus has always been wrong.
At one point I did a blog that was a catalog of things I thought were interesting in my life.
I did one with a political focus; that lasted for a couple of months.
One was about song writing.
As I write this, I still have a first blog post about how I was going to share my journey through designing a game and it has over 200 views (sorry to whoever saw that, became excited, and never got a second post).
The blog never went further than the first post and the game itself was abandoned soon after, as school and life demanded all of my attention&amp;mdash;or perhaps &amp;ldquo;sapped all of my motivation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I realize that I love to share things that I love.
It seems obvious.
Certainly, it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to stay motivated on a project when you&amp;rsquo;re doing something you love.
Having an audience for your work is a very intersting way to get motivation.
It forces a kind of responsibility to continue making progress and to continue sharing that progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a few projects rattling around in my head.
I&amp;rsquo;ll publish those in case you, my dear reader, decide that my proposals are great ideas you should spend your time on.
Until I get the ball rolling on one of those projects I&amp;rsquo;m going to dedicate this space to writing little blurbs about programming, my experiences, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t said what this blog is going to be about.
It&amp;rsquo;s going to be about everything, with the common thread being that it&amp;rsquo;s relevant to me somehow.
If that sounds egotistical, it is; but writing a blog is quite egotistical to begin with.
I dare to believe that the things I have to say are worth sharing with the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Might as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hope is that you&amp;rsquo;ll find what I have to say useful.
If not, then I&amp;rsquo;ll settle for &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;entertaining&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>About Me</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Josaphat Valdivia&lt;/em&gt; is Embedded Software Engineer and Co-Founder at &lt;strong&gt;Case Wallet Inc&lt;/strong&gt;.
He generally spends his time writing code of all varieties for all kinds of pet projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josaphat graduated from &lt;strong&gt;RIT&lt;/strong&gt; with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering (Software Engineering option) in May 2015.
He is not currently in search of employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josaphat is a proficient software developer, leveraging good Software Engineering practice in all of his projects.
His is proficient in C, C++, and Java, and knows enough Python and C# to break builds.
He can grok shell scripts, has experience programming for the web using tecnologies such as PHP, ASP.NET, and Javascript (both with and without JQuery).
He occasionally likes to mention that &amp;ldquo;Spanish is like a first language&amp;rdquo; to him because he is bilingual.
Though his proficiency in English surpassed his Spanish after years of English-only schooling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josaphat is skilled at wielding the English language, both written and spoken.
He is a confident public speaker and even won first place in the 2012 RIT Institute Speaking Contest with his speech about the number of people who don&amp;rsquo;t vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last six years of coursework and on-the-job experience, Josaphat has accumulated working knowledge of many development tools and technologies, including HCS12 assembly, Matlab, Octave, robotics, CSS, and GNU Assembler for Cortex-M ARM architectures.
During the past year or so he&amp;rsquo;s transitioned to using GNU/Linux as his primary computing environment and is now a mostly-former user of Microsoft Windows.
He uses git as his VCS of choice and knows how to leverage GNU/Linux as an integrated development environment.
His deitor of choice is vim (with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Josaphat/dotfiles&#34;&gt;a few additions&lt;/a&gt; though he is currently working on using emacs whenver time is not a constraint so that he can better unerstand how the other half lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josaphat took a course on computer graphics while at RIT and learned about the fundamentals of the subject using SDL as well as OpenGL.
He will with some regularly explore game design and development using SDL, OpenGL, and frameworks like XNA and Monogame, but his experiments rarely go further than creating small applications where users can move sprites on a screen with some rudimentary collision detection.
He is stubbornly satisfied with having learned a bit more about game design and game development with each foray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last couple of years he&amp;rsquo;s been an enthusiastic and increasingly proficient user of LaTeX, using it for lab reports, essays, proposals, etc.
He does know how to use more conventional office application suites, primarly LibreOffice, for when haste is required above formality.
In addition to the word processors of both LibreOffice and Microsoft Office, he knows how to use their respective spreadsheet applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, Josaphat has little free time, but when the opportunity arises he picks up his guitar and plays a few tunes, or plays video games, and explores some computing technology.
He intends for the blog on this site to showcase some of these hobby projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He and a group of friends from RIT are slowly making progress on a game called &amp;ldquo;Vale&amp;rdquo;, the concept for which his friends originally created as part of a course on developing games using DirectX.
The new version of Vale is being written using Monogame.
You can track its progress on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Hashrap/Vale--MonoGame-&#34;&gt;the GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;around-the-web:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47&#34;&gt;Around the Web&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow Josaphat on quite a few networks including
