	<p>Since the acquisition of GitHub by Microsoft in 2018, I&rsquo;ve looked at
the service a bit askance. But even though I&rsquo;m quasi against it,
GitHub&rsquo;s ethics have never really affected me or forced me to reckon
with them since I&rsquo;m not particularly active in any open source
projects and nobody cares about mine. Recently, though, I&rsquo;ve resolved
to live my values a bit better and am now working on ditching GitHub.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t pay GitHub. Back in the day, they stopped offering free public
repositories and it was at that point that I started using GitLab for
private projects that I just don&rsquo;t feel comfortable letting the world
see. I know nobody cares about my stuff, but I&rsquo;d still feel
self-conscious about it.  Especially if it&rsquo;s somewhere that potential
employers could see it.</p>
<p>And since I don&rsquo;t pay GitHub, and don&rsquo;t really use any of the
collaboration features myself (either as a contributor or maintainer),
the whole thing just provides a convenient, cloneable backup for code
I don&rsquo;t mind being public.</p>
<p>But still, I don&rsquo;t like where they&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>Even GitLab, where my private stuff is currently, they&rsquo;ve embraced
this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model">&ldquo;open core&rdquo;</a>
model that I&rsquo;m not really a fan of.  But, similar to my relationship
with GitHub, GitLab serves mostly as a backup for my private code. So
I sort of begrudgingly use GitLab and GitHub out of convenience: If
there&rsquo;s something better, I don&rsquo;t mind paying a few bucks a month to
support it.</p>

  <h6 style="margin-left: 100; width: 100; ">Side Note: </h6>
  <div style="float: right; margin-left: 200;">
    

<p>I don't begrudge companies making money off of closed-source or
proprietary software. I think they often are misguided as to whether
there's actually a <b>need</b> for their software to be
closed/proprietary, but nonetheless, I would consider myself as a
(very passive) Free Software advocate, not a zealot. The existence of
proprietary software doesn't bother me, I just wish more software was
Free.

<p>My objection with the GitLab model is just that it started as
something completely open source and has been wrapped up into
something that's not. The way they manage the open-source vs
proprietary editions is pretty transparent and people seem to be
mostly okay with how they've managed it thus far, but at any point
they could turn bad. Plus, now that they're a public company, they're
beholden to their shareholders over their customers, users, and
contributors.

<p>So at some point after the GitHub acquisition, I started casually
looking into good alternatives (both for GitHub and GitLab). I didn&rsquo;t
really find anything I wanted to commit to and the whole thing sort of
slipped my mind as I became busy with other things. Then at some point
I stumbled onto <a href="https://sourcehut.org">sourcehut</a>. It looked
promising. In December of 2020 I claimed
<a href="https://sr.ht/~jos">sr.ht/~jos</a>, and decided that I wanted to support
the project. I subscribed for their $50/year tier and&hellip; promptly did
nothing with it. And I mean that literally. It wasn&rsquo;t until almost a
year and a half later, just this past May of 2022, that I uploaded an
ssh key, set up 2FA, and resolved to start using it.</p>
<p>The recent <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/">controversy</a> in
some circles around GitHub&rsquo;s co-pilot spurred me to finally get
serious about migrating. In addition to sourcehut, I&rsquo;ve also claimed
<a href="https://codeberg.org/josaphat">codeberg.org/josaphat</a> since they&rsquo;re
quite similar to GitHub. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d recommend sourcehut to any
friends or colleagues who aren&rsquo;t well-versed with git; I&rsquo;d refer them
to codeberg instead.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve almost got myself migrated off of GitHub. For now, I plan on
leaving my repositories on there and just referring people to either
sourcehut or codeberg, depending on the project.</p>
<p>The last thing on my todo list is to stop using GitHub Pages. This
site is currently hosted on GitHub Pages, as is howoldis.space. I
thought about setting something up with a cloud service provider, but
since Codeberg has Codeberg Pages, I&rsquo;ll just migrate to that.</p>
<p>At that point I&rsquo;ll be off of GitHub.</p>
