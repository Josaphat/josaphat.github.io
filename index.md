This is my home page, made very quickly using [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/).

The quote is by Matsuo Basho and it was the shortest quote I found after googling "quotes about starting a journey".

## Pages
There are no pages here beyond this page, the boiler-plate "categories", "tags" and "archive" pages that you can find in the navigation bar, and an [About](/about/) page you might be interested in viewing. If I don't link it here, you'd need to dive into the Pages page and somehow parse that it is a more important page than 'Sitemap'.

Work on the navigation of this site is to be done in the near future.
Thanks for your interest!
